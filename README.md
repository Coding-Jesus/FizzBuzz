# FizzBuzz
A simple program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
## Code
The code consists of a loop that iterates from 1 to 100, and uses if statements to check if the current number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. If it is, the appropriate string is logged to the console. If not, the number itself is logged.

An alternative version of the code is also included, which uses the modulo operator and ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way.
